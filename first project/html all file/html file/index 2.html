<h2><ins>•My Name is Amerigo…</ins></h2>
<p>My name is Amerigo, I am 13 years old and I live on the street, alone.  My mother, who is separated from my father, doesn’t want me. She told me to go away …… Now she is married to another man. My father lives very far away. I want to go to him, but he won’t  take me either. I begged him to send me some money so that I could buy a bus ticket. I am still waiting. He hasn’t answered.
The streets are now my home. Sometimes I find work. I used to collect trash and sell it to a vendor. I stopped doing that after I had a serious infection and a doctor told me to stay away from the trash bump. Once I worked for an ice cream shop owner and sold ice cream on the beach. But I got  no money in return. The owner of the shop gave me something to eat, and let me sleep in his hut at night. The work was difficult and painful. The ice cream box is quite heavy when it is full. I had to walk for hours, offering my ice cream to whoever wanted to buy. There were days when I could not even sell one ice cream.
In a way, I am lucky because I am alive. My friends who work sorting rubbish in dumps often suffer from serious diseases. One of them was recently dilled after he fell into a hole that opened up in the pile of trash. Many of us work for 10 to 12 hours, and get so little in return that we can’t even buy food.
Shoe-shining is very popular among the street kids. A few of my friends also word in factories and workshops . A boy I know lost one of his eyes after a piece of hot glass flew into his eye at the glass factory where he worked. The owner refused to pay for medical help and fired him.
For me, like all other children on the street, it is very hard. I am always hungry, and I don’t know where I will sleep the next night. I would like to live in my own home and sleep there in peace. The nights are very cold in the winter. You can die of cold in the street.

<h2><ins>•Mental Depression…</ins></h2>
<p>There are very few persons who are free from tensions and stresses of life. Most of these tensions are our own creations because we don’t know how to cope with them.
Our body is like a friend with whome we spend our life. 
As we advance in age, we start learning its strength and weaknesses. If we give our body the time and attention it deserves, it can prove to be a good friend. Of all the organs and systems of our body, the brain and its associated parts in the nervous system are of great importance to the normal functioning of the body.
The condition of the mind affects the health of a person to a far greater extent than many people realize. Many of the diseases from which man suffers and the result of mental depression. Courage, hope, faith, sympathy and love promote health and prolong life. Grief, anxiety, discontentment, remorse, guilt and distrust all tend to break down the life forces and lead to decay and death. One should fix one’s mind upon cheerful things. A spirit of gratitude and praise for our blessings promotes health of body and soul. If we talk of pleasant and happy things, our pleasant and happy feelings will be stronger. If we think and talk of sadness and discouragement, we weaken these feelings. So we should try our best to resist melancholy, sad, gloomy thoughts and feelings, rather than thinking and speaking of them all the time.
A person suffering from nervousness or a person who is not able to get good sleep has excessive muscle tension. Muscle relaxation exercises are beneficial to such a person. Nervousness and mental illness are associated with scattered thoughts. Thought causes muscle tension and muscle tension is essential for thought. When tension is completely relaxed in a person, thought is not possible. Thought affects the face muscles more than any other muscles of the body. So we must get rid of tension if we are to get relief from nervousness and lack of sleep.
